I am a researcher engineer at [JHU SNF AGORA](https://snfagora.jhu.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Yuen Yuen Ang](https://snfagora.jhu.edu/person/yuen-yuen-ang/) and [Prof. Charles Chang](https://charleschang.me/). My research interests span **LLMs for science**, **computational social science**, and **AI agents**.

I received my dual M.S. degrees in **Computer Science** and **Information Systems** from Johns Hopkins University and my B.S. degree in **Informatics** from the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences of University of California, Irvine (UCI). Previously, I worked at the **Digital Learning Lab**, supervised by [Prof. Mark Warschauer](https://markwarschauer.com/) and Dr. Dandan Yang. 

I am open to collaborations and welcome anyone interested to reach out! Feel free to contact me via email (bsun26 AT jhu.edu) or wechat (ID: sun565563323).
